NORMAL TASKS:


@END: 
- Run black formatter on all files.

STRETCH TASKS:
- Run extended scraper for all 50k anime ids. Check for the ids 1, 7, 8, 15. Seemingly, if we catch 7, we don't catch 8. It has something to do with the attributes making the try-catch fail.

COMPLETED TASKS:
- Run extended scraper for all 50k anime ids.
